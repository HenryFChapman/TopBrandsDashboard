      <p>Infegy's top brands dashboard is a tool that allows users to track and analyze the performance of the world's top brands. The data for the dashboard is sourced from Interbrand, a leading global brand consultancy that produces annual rankings of the world's most valuable brands.</a> </p>

      <p>We use natural language processing techniques to analyze the words and phrases used online to make predictions about the emotions that the text is likely to evoke in a reader. We do this by training machine learning algorithms on large datasets of text that have been labeled with emotional tags, like "trust." The AI system can then use this training to analyze new text and predict the emotions that it is likely to evoke in a reader. These were the brands with the highest annual Trust Score, or the brands with the highest percentage of online posts containing trust. </a> </p>
